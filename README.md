# simple-cve-stats
Shell script to generate some basics stats based on CVE nightly dump.

This uses the 'allitems.csv.gz' updated nightly by MITRE that contains a dump of CVE data. Using simple grep / wc, do yearly stats along with a few numbers for the overall dump. If you run this daily and track the data, you can start to see fun patterns and track CVE growth.

The last line is commented out, but where you can mail the results out.
