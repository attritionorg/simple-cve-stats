# simple-cve-stats
Shell script to generate some basics stats based on CVE nightly dump.

This uses the 'allitems.csv.gz' updated nightly by MITRE that contains a dump of CVE data. Using simple grep / wc, do yearly stats along with a few numbers for the overall dump. If you run this daily and track the data, you can start to see fun patterns and track CVE growth.
